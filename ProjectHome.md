This is an implementation of the ["Dancing Links"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links) approach to solving Sudoku puzzles. The front-end is implemented with GWT, and the server-side (both the solver and the servlet that takes puzzle requests) are implemented in Scala.

The whole thing is running [live on App Engine here](http://gwtdlx.appspot.com)!
